# Cybersecurity-using-BB84-Protocol-And-QKD
About This project implements the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol — a secure cryptographic method that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to generate and share encryption keys between two parties. BB84 ensures that any attempt at eavesdropping can be detected due to quantum measurement disturbance.
